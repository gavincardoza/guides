## Overview

As of September 2014, Clojure has over a dozen books published (or available for
preview) about it, plus one about ClojureScript. This guide lists some of them
in reverse chronological order and intended to provide a very brief
overview of each. It is by no means comprehensive and may be quite
opinionated. The goal is to identify books that are more useful to
newcomers than others and recommend books that cover recent releases
of Clojure (1.3+).
